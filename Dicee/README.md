#  Dicee

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps you’ll build in the future. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, all while building a useful dice shaker app.

## What you will create

We’re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, you’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!

## What you will learn

* How to set up a new Xcode project.
* How to use Interface builder to design and create the appearance of your app.
* How to find your way around the storyboard.
